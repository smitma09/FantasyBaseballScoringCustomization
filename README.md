# FantasyBaseballScoringCustomization
A personal project created for the purpose of seeing the effect of different scoring settings on the final point totals of players in a fantasy baseball league. Different scoring settings can make different players more or less valuable, so it can be beneficial for league managers to be able to test out different scoring settings and seeing the point totals for all players before finalizing a scoring system.

There are 2 different Python files in this project, one for batters and one for pitchers. The .txt files contain the statistics of each batter or pitcher from either 2016 or 2015. The .txt files must be placed in the same directory as the Python files in order for the programs to run without modification. Upon running one of the Python files, you will be prompted to enter the point totals for different categories under the scoring system you would like to test out. You will also be prompted to enter the year of the stats you would like the point totals to be based on (currently supported for 2016 or 2015). The program will then print out the point totals in order of greatest to least, along with the player, their team, and their position/s.
